I am a Full-stack web development student from Masai School who is passionate about building dynamic websites and web applications.

I implemented React, Node.js, Express, Mongodb, and so on in my projects. Apart from technical skills, I also learned how to manage time, solve complex problems and collaborate with others. I grew as a person and professional in this time.

I look forward to working on challenging projects that are user-friendly and that solve significant problems.
